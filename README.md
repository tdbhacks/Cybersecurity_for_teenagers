# Cybersecurity_for_teenagers
   A simple interactive website to teach young teenagers the basics of Cybersecurity, developed as part of one of the
  English classes I took at my University. The template I used is "Kiddo", by WebThemez.com.
  
  
  The website is targeted at young teenagers, who are the ones who risk the most online. In fact, a simple, fancy-looking
  popup message may be enough to share sensitive information with malicious software, if they do not have the basic
  knowledge required to be safe online. They know the internet is a magical box capable of answering almost every question,
  providing printable templates of any animal to color in, and providing endlessly-repeatable videos of cute cats, cartoons
  and loom band tutorials. According to a survey conducted by Intel and the Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI), parents
  mainly discuss issues related to cyberbullying and privacy, like identity theft, online reputation and privacy
  settings (“Most Discussed Topics…”).
  
  Thus, children seem to be prepared from this point of view.
	The scary part, is that no one is teaching them how to create a strong password or protect against malware.
  They don’t know anything about viruses, phishing, and any other internet safety issue that involves an actual attacker
  trying to gain advantage of their misjudgment. Spam, some of which includes scam messages, becomes an issue for children
  in several different contexts: through email, texts, and the chat functions of games and online worlds, which are becoming
  extremely popular forms of entertainment among children, as noted by David Riley, executive director of the marketing
  research company NPD group (“Kids and Gaming”). Kids need to be taught to never reply to spam and to never follow unknown links.
  
  
  By introducing them to these kinds of threats, they can learn about them in a safe environment, without having to go through
  the struggle of trying to remove a hostile virus or deleting hundreds of spam emails a day due to inadvertent disclosures
  of personal information. Also, once they get accustomed to online safety guidelines, protecting themselves against those
  kinds of attacks would be considered just part of their normal digital routines and would prevent them from being the victims
  of some malicious user in the future.
